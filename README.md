## Algorithms Course (4th semester)

All my code is in C++


#### Lab 1

* [direct_address.cpp](lab1/direct_address.cpp) - Implement direct addressing in a table.
* [hashing_with_chaining.cpp](lab1/hashing_with_chaining.cpp) - Implement hashing with chaining.
* [queue_2stacks.cpp](lab1/queue_2stacks.cpp) - Queue built using 2 stacks.
* [sort_2_queues.cpp](lab1/sort_2_queues.cpp) and [sort_1_queue.cpp](lab1/sort_1_queue.cpp) - Write a routine for changing a sequence of elements in a queue according to a specified input permutation using two temporary queues. Do the same using a single temporary queue.
* [sort_2_stacks.cpp](lab1/sort_2_stacks.cpp) - Write a routine for changing a sequence of elements in a stack according to a specified permutation using two temporary stacks.
* [conditional_queue_stack.cpp](lab1/conditional_queue_stack.cpp) - A data structure that behaves like both stack and queue. If number of elements in it is more than 8, then deletion takes place like stack (LIFO) otherwise like queue (FIFO).
* [stack_transfer.cpp](lab1/stack_transfer.cpp) - Write a routine for transferring the elements of a stack to a second
stack in the same order, using a third stack as working space.
